# SLA-Breach-Analysis
Project was build to analyze customer support tickets to understand SLA breaches, response times, and customer satisfaction using a Kaggle synthetic dataset

## Questions/Objectives

1. How many tickets breached SLA, broken down by priority (low, medium, high, critical)​
3. Which channels (email, chat, phone, social) have the highest SLA breach rate?
4. For SLA breaches, what is the average time to resolution vs. tickets that met SLA?

### Why does high breach rate happen?
High breach rate occurs when there is understaffing or poor routing between channels and priorities

### What does this impact? What should we fix first?
Breach tickets impacts aspects that leaders care about most:
1. Customer satisfaction - Longer waits and broken promises
2. Churn and revenue - Unhappy customers which leads to cuts in future revenue
3. Brand Trust - If support doesn't meet SLA patterns start to show and people stop believing in a companies promises
4. Support costs - Messy and slow tickets, escalations and handle time requires more staff for the same volume
5. Ops planning - Knowing which channel/priority combo causes delays lets managers plan ahead for better staffing, routing and training plans
